Components of Seafile server run on specific TCP ports. If you have firewall in your server environment, you have to keep these ports open.

These ports can be either configured in setup-seafile.sh script, or set as parameter for seafile.sh and seahub.sh scripts.

By default, you should open 4 ports.
