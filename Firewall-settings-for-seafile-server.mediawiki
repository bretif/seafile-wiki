Components of Seafile server run on specific TCP ports. If you have firewall in your server environment, you have to keep these ports open.

These ports can be either configured in setup-seafile.sh script, or set as parameter for seafile.sh and seahub.sh scripts.

By default, you should open 4 ports.

{|
| Seahub
| 8000
|-
| HttpServer
| 8082
|-
| Ccnet Daemon
| 10001
|-
| Seafile Daemon
| 12001
|}

If you run Seafile behind Nginx/Apache with HTTPS, you should open ports

{|
| HTTPS
| 443
|-
| Ccnet Daemon
| 10001
|-
| Seafile Daemon
| 12001
|}

== seaf-server ==

* Default port: 12001
* Configured by setup-seafile.sh

== seahub ==

* Default port: 8000
* Can be set a parameter for seahub.sh script. e.g. "./seahub.sh start 8002"
* Not need to open if you config seafile with Nginx/Apache
