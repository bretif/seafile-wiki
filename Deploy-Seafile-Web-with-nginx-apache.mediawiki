'''Note:''' This document is for seafile server 1.4 and later. For an old version, see [[Deploy Seafile Web With Nginx/Apache old|here]].

In a production environment, you often want to deploy Seafile Web(Seahub) behind a reverse proxy like Apache or nginx. Using a web server serves multiple purposes:

* Static files can be served by Apache/Nginx directly to achieve better performance.
* You need to use Apache/Nginx if you want to [[Enable Https on Seafile Web]].

Before continuing, ensure that:

* you have installed the <code>python-flup</code> library
* you have '''NOT''' started seahub or seafile

== Deploy with nginx ==

Assume you are running seahub as the root domain, for example '''www.myseafile.com'''

This is a sample nginx config file.

<pre>
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.myseafile.com;
    location / {
        fastcgi_pass    127.0.0.1:8000;
        fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME     $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO           $fastcgi_script_name;

        fastcgi_param	SERVER_PROTOCOL		$server_protocol;
        fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING        $query_string;
        fastcgi_param   REQUEST_METHOD      $request_method;
        fastcgi_param   CONTENT_TYPE        $content_type;
        fastcgi_param   CONTENT_LENGTH      $content_length;
        fastcgi_param	SERVER_ADDR         $server_addr;
        fastcgi_param	SERVER_PORT         $server_port;
        fastcgi_param	SERVER_NAME         $server_name;

        access_log      /var/log/nginx/seahub.access.log;
    	error_log       /var/log/nginx/seahub.error.log;
    }       

    location /media {
        root /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-1.6.1/seahub;
    }
}
</pre>

== Deploy With Apache ==

Before deploying with Apache, you need to configure Apache first. Install and enable mod_fastcgi and also enable mod_rewrite (which is usually installed by default).

Then edit httpd.conf file, add this line:

  FastCGIExternalServer /var/www/seahub.fcgi -host 127.0.0.1:8000

After that, assume you are running seahub as the root domain, for example '''www.myseafile.com'''. Note, "/var/www/seahub.fcgi" is just a placeholder, you don't need to actually have this file in your system.

This is a sample apache config file.

<pre>
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName www.myseafile.com
  DocumentRoot /var/www
  Alias /media  /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-1.6.1/seahub/media         
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^/(media.*)$ /$1 [QSA,L,PT]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /seahub.fcgi$1 [QSA,L,E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
</VirtualHost>
</pre>

Note: HTTP_AUTHORIZATION is used in API authorization


== Start Seafile and Seahub ==

Before you start seafile and seahub, you first need to modify the file <code>ccnet.conf</code> and <code>seahub_settings.py</code>.

=== Modify ccnet.conf ===

Modify the value of <code>SERVICE_URL</code> in <code>/data/haiwen/ccnet/ccnet.conf</code>

<pre>
SERVICE_URL = http://www.myseafile.com
</pre>

'''Note: '''If you later change the domain assigned to seahub, you also need to change the value of  <code>SERVICE_URL</code>.


=== Modify seahub_setting.py ===

Add this line,
<pre>
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True
</pre>

=== Start Seafile/Seahub (when using the pre-compiled server package) ===

Assume you have followed the steps in [[Download and Setup Seafile Server]], please run commands as follows:

<pre>
./seafile.sh start
./seahub.sh start-fastcgi
</pre>

=== Start Seafile/Seahub (when building seafile server from source) ===

Assume you have followed the steps of [[Build and Deploy Seafile Server from source]]. To start seafile, and start seahub in fastcgi mode, you should:

<pre>
seafile-admin start --fastcgi
</pre>

The default port is <code>8000</code>, to use another port, just append a <code>--port</code> argument:

<pre>
seafile-admin start --fastcgi --port [PORT]
</pre>

== Deploy Seafile at Non-root domain ==

See [[Deploy Seafile Web at Non root domain]]

== Notes when Upgrading Seafile Server ==

When [[upgrading seafile server]], besides the normal steps you should take, there is one extra step to do: '''Update the path of the static files in your nginx/apache configuration'''. For example, assume your are upgrading seafile server 1.3.0 to 1.4.0, then:

* For Nginx:

```
    location /media {
        root /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-1.4.0/seahub;
    }
```
* For Apache:

```
  Alias /media  /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-1.4.0/seahub/media
```
