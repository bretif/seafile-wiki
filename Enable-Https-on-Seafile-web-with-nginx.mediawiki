== Enable https on Seahub ==

Note: Seafile has two web components, Seahub and HttpServer. Seahub is to serve normal web pages and Http-server is to serve only raw file uploading/downloading. You need set both parts to use https. 

Here we use self-signed SSL digital certificate for free. If you use a paid ssl certificate from some authority, just skip the first step.

=== Generate SSL digital certificate with OpenSSL ===
<pre>
    openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048
    openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 1095
</pre>

=== Enable SSL module of Nginx (optional) ===
If your Nginx does not support SSL, you need to recompile it, the commands are as follows:
<pre>
    ./configure --with-http_stub_status_module --with-http_ssl_module
    make && make install
</pre>

=== Modify Nginx configuration file ===

Assume you have configured nginx as [[Deploy-Seafile-with-nginx]]. To use https, you need to modify your nginx configuration file.
<pre>
    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  www.yourdoamin.com; 
        rewrite ^/(.*) https://$server_name/$1 permanent;	# force redirect http to https
        }
    server
    {
    listen 443;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cacert.pem;	# path to your cacert.pem
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/privkey.pem;	# path to your privkey.pem
    server_name www.yourdoamin.com;    
    ......
    ......
    fastcgi_param   HTTPS   on;
    }
</pre>

=== Sample configuration file ===

Here is the sample configuration file:

<pre>
    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  www.yourdoamin.com;
        rewrite ^/(.*) https://$server_name/$1 permanent;	# force redirect http to https
    }
    server {
        listen 443;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cacert.pem;            # path to your cacert.pem
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/privkey.pem;	# path to your privkey.pem
        server_name www.yourdoamin.com;    
        location / {
            fastcgi_pass    127.0.0.1:8000;
            fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME     $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO           $fastcgi_script_name;
     
            fastcgi_param   SERVER_PROTOCOL	$server_protocol;
            fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING        $query_string;
            fastcgi_param   REQUEST_METHOD      $request_method;
            fastcgi_param   CONTENT_TYPE        $content_type;
            fastcgi_param   CONTENT_LENGTH      $content_length;
            fastcgi_param   SERVER_ADDR         $server_addr;
            fastcgi_param   SERVER_PORT         $server_port;
            fastcgi_param   SERVER_NAME         $server_name;
            fastcgi_param   HTTPS   on;
            fastcgi_param HTTP_SCHEME https;
     
            access_log      /var/log/nginx/seahub.access.log;
    	    error_log       /var/log/nginx/seahub.error.log;
        }       
        location /seafhttp {
            rewrite ^/seafhttp(.*)$ $1 break;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8082;
            client_max_body_size 0;
        }
        location /media {
            root /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-1.6.1/seahub;
        }
    }
</pre>

=== Reload Nginx ===
<pre>
    nginx -s reload
</pre>

=== Test Https ===

Open your browser, and input https://www.yourdomain.com, if you see a security alert dialog, that means Https is enabled.

== Modify settings to use https ==

=== ccnet conf ===

Since you change from http to https, you need to modify the value of "SERVICE_URL" in <code>ccnet/ccnet.conf</code>:
<pre>
SERVICE_URL = https://www.yourdomain.com
</pre>

=== seahub_settings.py ===

```python
HTTP_SERVER_ROOT = 'https://www.yourdomain.com/seafhttp'
```
