== Enable https on Seahub ==

Here we use self-signed SSL digital certificate for free. If you use a paid ssl certificate from some authority, just skip the first step.

=== Generate SSL digital certificate with OpenSSL ===
```bash
    openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048
    openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 1095
```

=== Enable SSL module of Nginx (optional) ===
If your Nginx does not support SSL, you need to recompile it, the commands are as follows:
```bash
    ./configure --with-http_stub_status_module --with-http_ssl_module
    make && make install
```

=== Modify Nginx configuration file ===

Assume you have configured nginx as [[Deploy-Seafile-with-nginx]]. To use https, you need to modify your nginx configuration file.
```nginx
    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  www.yourdoamin.com; 
        rewrite ^ https://$http_host$request_uri? permanent;	# force redirect http to https
    }

    server {
        listen 443;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cacert.pem;	# path to your cacert.pem
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/privkey.pem;	# path to your privkey.pem
        server_name www.yourdoamin.com;    
        # ......
        fastcgi_param   HTTPS               on;
        fastcgi_param   HTTP_SCHEME         https;
    }
```


=== Sample configuration file ===

Here is the sample configuration file:

```nginx
    server {
      listen       80;
      server_name  seafile.example.net;
      rewrite ^ https://$http_host$request_uri? permanent;      # force redirect http to https
  }
  server {
      listen 443;
      ssl on;
      add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains";
      server_name seafile.example.net;
      # global SSL options with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) high strength ciphers
 # first. PFS ciphers are those which start with ECDHE which means (EC)DHE
 # which stands for (Elliptic Curve) Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral.
  ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA;
  ssl_ecdh_curve secp521r1;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.1 TLSv1;
  resolver 8.8.8.8;
  ssl_stapling on;
# ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:20m;
 ssl_session_timeout 10m; # SPDY timeout=1800sec, keepalive=200sec; connection close=session expires
      location / {
          fastcgi_pass    127.0.0.1:8000;
          fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME     $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO           $fastcgi_script_name;

          fastcgi_param   SERVER_PROTOCOL       $server_protocol;
          fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING        $query_string;
          fastcgi_param   REQUEST_METHOD      $request_method;
          fastcgi_param   CONTENT_TYPE        $content_type;
          fastcgi_param   CONTENT_LENGTH      $content_length;
          fastcgi_param   SERVER_ADDR         $server_addr;
          fastcgi_param   SERVER_PORT         $server_port;
          fastcgi_param   SERVER_NAME         $server_name;
          fastcgi_param   HTTPS               on;
          fastcgi_param   HTTP_SCHEME         https;

          access_log      /var/log/nginx/seahub.access.log;
            error_log       /var/log/nginx/seahub.error.log;
      } 
      location /seafhttp {
          rewrite ^/seafhttp(.*)$ $1 break;
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8082;
          client_max_body_size 0;

      location /media {
          root /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-latest/seahub;
      }
  }


```

=== Reload Nginx ===
```bash
    nginx -s reload
```

== Modify settings to use https ==

=== ccnet conf ===

Since you change from http to https, you need to modify the value of "SERVICE_URL" in <code>ccnet/ccnet.conf</code>:
```bash
SERVICE_URL = https://www.yourdomain.com
```

=== seahub_settings.py ===

```python
HTTP_SERVER_ROOT = 'https://www.yourdomain.com/seafhttp'
```

== Start Seafile and Seahub ==

```bash
./seafile.sh start
./seahub.sh start-fastcgi
```
