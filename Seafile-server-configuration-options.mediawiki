This manual explains how to change various config options for Seafile server. We assume that you've [[Download-and-setup-seafile-server|setup Seafile server]]. 

== Seafile Network Configurations (ccnet.conf) ==

You may change Seafile's network options by modifying `ccnet/ccnet.conf` file. Let's walk through the options by an example.

<pre>
[General]

# This option is not used by Seafile server
USER_NAME=example

# Please don't change this ID.
ID=eb812fd276432eff33bcdde7506f896eb4769da0

# This is the name of this Seafile server. It'll be displayed on Seafile client program.
NAME=example

# This is the URL for Seahub(Seafile Web). It'll be displayed on Seafile client program.
# The domain part (i.e., www.example.com) will also be used by the client to connect the server.
SERVICE_URL=http://www.example.com:8000


[Network]

# Ccnet waits for client connections on this port. If it's used by other services, please change it.
PORT=10001

[Client]
# Ccnet listens to this port on localhost for local clients' request (e.g. seahub website).
# If it's been used by other services, ccnet and seafile would not be able to run.
PORT=13419

</pre>

You should restart seafile so that your changes take effect.

<pre>
cd seafile-server
./seafile.sh restart
</pre>

== Storage Quota Setting (seafile.conf) ==

You may set a default quota (e.g. 2GB) for all users. To do this, just add the following lines to `seafile-data/seafile.conf` file

<pre>
[quota]
# default user quota in GB, integer only
default = 2
</pre>

This setting applies to all users. If you want to set quota for a specific user, you may log in to seahub website as administrator, then set it in "System Admin" page.

== seafile httpserver configuratoin (seafile.conf) ==

The configuration of seafile httpserver is in the <code>[httpserver]</code> section of the file <code>seafile-data/seafile.conf</code>

If you want to use another port for httpesrver, or enable https on httpserver, you need to modify the httpserver configuration; Otherwise, you can leave it as it is. See [[Enable Https on Seafile Web]] for more details on how to enable https for seafile web and httpserver.

<pre>
[httpserver]
# tcp port for httpserver
port = 8082
# use https or not
https=true
# if https is used, the path to the SSL pemfile and privkey must be provided.
pemfile=/path/to/ssl/pemfile/
privkey=/path/to/ssl/privkey
</pre>

Default maximum upload file size is 100M, you can modify this setting.
<pre>
[httpserver]
# Set maximum upload file size to 200M.
max_upload_size=200
</pre>

== Seahub Configurations (seahub_settings.py) ==

=== Sending Email Notifications on Seahub ===

If you want to setup email notifications, please add the following lines to seahub_settings.py (and set your email server).

<pre>

EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.domain.com'        # smpt server
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username@domain.com'    # username
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'    # password
EMAIL_PORT = '25'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
SERVER_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
</pre>

<pre>
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username@gmail.com'
