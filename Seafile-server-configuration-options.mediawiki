This manual explains how to change various config options for Seafile server. We assume that you've [[Download-and-setup-seafile-server|setup Seafile server]]. 

== Seafile Network Configurations ==

You may change Seafile's network options by modifying ccnet/ccnet.conf file. Let's walk through the options by an example.

<pre>
[General]

# This option is not used by Seafile server
USER_NAME=example

# Please don't change this ID.
ID=eb812fd276432eff33bcdde7506f896eb4769da0

# This is the name of this Seafile server. It'll be displayed on Seafile client program.
NAME=example

# This is the URL for seahub website
SERVICE_URL=http://www.example.com:8000


[Network]

# Ccnet waits for client connections on this port. If it's used by other services, please change it.
PORT=10001

[Client]
# Ccnet listens to this port on localhost for local clients' request (e.g. seahub website).
# If it's been used by other services, ccnet and seafile would not be able to run.
PORT=13419

</pre>

You should restart seafile so that your changes take effect.

<pre>
cd seafile-server
./seafile.sh restart
</pre>

== Seahub Configurations ==

=== Sending Email Notifications on Seahub ===

A few features work better if it can send email notifications, such as notifying users about new messages.
If you want to setup email notifications, please add the following lines to seahub_settings.py (and set your email server).

<pre>
EMAIL_USE_TLS = False
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.163.com'        # smpt server
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username@163.com'    # username
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'    # password
EMAIL_PORT = '25'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL ="username@163.com"    # username
</pre>

=== Seahub Settings ===

You may change seahub website's settings in seahub_settings.py.

<pre>

# You should change 'localhost' to your server's IP address, but keep the port 8082.
# Otherwise you won't be able to download or preview files on seahub website.
HTTP_SERVER_ROOT = "http://localhost:8082"

# Set this to seahub website's URL. This URL is contained in email notifications.
SITE_BASE = 'http://gonggeng.org/'

# Set this to your website's name. This is contained in email notifications.
SITE_NAME = 'gonggeng'

# Set seahub website's title
SEAHUB_TITLE = 'SeaCloud'

# If you don't want to run seahub website on your site's root path, set this option to your preferred path.
# e.g. setting it to '/seahub/' would run seahub on http://example.com/seahub/.
SITE_ROOT = '/'

</pre>
