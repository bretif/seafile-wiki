== When downloading a library, the client hangs at "connecting server" ==

First, you can check the ccnet.log in client (~/.ccnet/logs/ccnet.log for Linux, C:/users/your_name/ccnet/logs/ccnet.log for Windows) to see what's wrong.

Possible reasons:

* Miss config of  <code>SERVICE_URL</code>: Check whether the value of is set correctly in server's <code>ccnet.conf</code>.
* Using a server name in file `hosts`, (Currently, seafile client can't use hosts file to resolve server).
* Firewall: Ensure the firewall is configured properly. See [[Firewall Settings for Seafile Server ]]

Trouble shooting:

* Click the  download button of a library, this will redirect you to a local address like http://localhost:13420/repo/download/?relay_id=...&relay_addr=cloud.seafile.com&relay_port=10001. Check the relay_addr and relay_port part. These two parameters are used by the client to connect the server.
* Manually telnet to see if you can connect: <code>telnet cloud.seafile.com 10001</code>
