== When downloading a library, the client hangs at "connecting server" ==

First, you can check the ccnet.log in client (~/.ccnet/logs/ccnet.log for Linux, C:/users/your_name/ccnet/logs/ccnet.log for Windows) to see what's wrong.

Possible reasons:

* Miss config of  <code>SERVICE_URL</code>: Check whether the value of is set correctly in server's <code>ccnet.conf</code>.
* Firewall: Ensure the firewall is configured properly. See [[Firewall Settings for Seafile Server ]]

Trouble shooting:

* Click the  download button of a library, this will redirect you to a local address like http://localhost:13420/repo/download/?relay_id=...&relay_addr=cloud.seafile.com&relay_port=10001. Check the relay_addr and relay_port part. These two parameters are used by the client to connect the server.
* Manually telnet to see if you can connect: <code>telnet cloud.seafile.com 10001</code> 

== Does Seafile server support Python 3? ==

No, You must have python 2.6 or 2.7 installed on your server.

== Website displays "Page unavailable", what can I do? ==

* You can check the back trace in seahub log files (/tmp/seahub_django_request.log, /tmp/seahub.log).

* You can also turn on debug by adding <code>DEBUG = True</code> to seahub_settings.py and restart seahub by <code>./seahub.sh restart</code>, then refresh that page, all the debug infomations will be displayed.

== Avatar pictures vanished after upgrading server, what can I do? ==

* You need to check whether the "avatars" symbolic link under seahub/media/ is correctly link to ../../../seahub-data/avatars. If not, you need to correct the link according to the "minor upgrade" section in [[Upgrading-Seafile-Server]]

* If your avatars link is correctly linked, and avatars are still broken, you may refresh seahub cache by <code>rm -rf /tmp/seahub_cache/*</code>

== Failed to upload/download file online ==

* Make sure you firewall for seafile httpserver is opened.

== Failed to open txt/md file online, other files are OK ==

Make sure your server can connect itself via the domain name.
