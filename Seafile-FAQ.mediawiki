* Check whether the value of <code>SERVICE_URL</code> is set correctly in <code>ccnet.conf</code>. It should be like this:
```conf
# <http or https>://<domain or ip>:<port>
SERVICE_URL = http://seafile.myserver.com:8000

If you later change the address of your seahub website, e.g. you use a different ip/domain or port, or [[Enable Https on Seafile Web|change from http to https]], you must update the value of <code>SERVICE_URL</code> accordingly, and then restart the seafile server.
