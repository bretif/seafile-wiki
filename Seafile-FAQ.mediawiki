== When downloading a library, the client hangs at "connecting server" ==

* Ensure the firewall is configured properly. See [[Firewall Settings for Seafile Server ]]
* Check whether the value of <code>SERVICE_URL</code> is set correctly in <code>ccnet.conf</code>. It should be like this:
```conf
# <http or https>://<domain or ip>:<port>
SERVICE_URL = http://seafile.myserver.com:8000
```

<code>SERVICE_URL</code> must always point to the address of your seahub website. If you later change the address of your seahub website, e.g. you use a different ip/domain or port, or [[Enable Https on Seafile Web|change from http to https]], you must update the value of <code>SERVICE_URL</code> accordingly, and then restart the seafile server.
