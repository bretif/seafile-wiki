Seafile WebDAV Server(SeafDAV) is added in seafile server 2.1.0.

In the wiki below, we assume your seafile installation folder is <code>/data/haiwen</code>.

== SeafDAV Configuration ==

The configuration file is <code>/data/haiwen/seafile-data/seafdav.conf</code>

```conf
[WEBDAV]

# Default is false. Change it to true to enable SeafDAV server.
enabled = true

port = 8080

# Change the value of fastcgi to true if fastcgi is to be used
fastcgi = false

# If you deploy seafdav behind nginx/apache, you need to modify "share_name".
share_name = /
```

Every time the configuration is modified, you need to restart seafile server to make it take effect.

```sh
./seafile.sh restart
```


=== Sample Configuration 1: No nginx/apache ===

Your WebDAV client would visit the Seafile WebDAV server at <code>http://example.com:8080</code>

```conf
[WEBDAV]
enabled = true
port = 8080
fastcgi = false
share_name = /
```

=== Sample Configuration 2: With nginx/apache ===

Your WebDAV client would visit the Seafile WebDAV server at <code>http://example.com/seafdav</code>

```conf
[WEBDAV]
enabled = true
port = 8080
fastcgi = true
share_name = /seafdav
```

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=== Clients can't connect to seafdav sersver ===

By default, seafdav is disabled. Check whether you have <code>enabled = true</code> in <code>seafdav.conf</code>.
If not, modify it and restart seafile server.


=== The client gets "Error: 404 Not Found" ===

If you deploy SeafDAV behind Nginx/Apache, make sure to change the value of <code>share_name</code> as the sample configuration above. Restart your seafile server and try again.
