Before seafile server 1.4.5, if you built seafile server from source and used the seafile-admin script, your directory layout would not be correct, which means you can't use the upgrade scripts when upgrading seafile server.

To make things work correctly, follow the instructions on this page step by step.

=== The Old, Incorret Layout ===

<pre>
haiwen/
└── ccnet/
└── seafile-data/
└── seahub/
    └── seahub.db
└── runtime/
</pre>

=== The New, Correct Layout ===

<pre>
haiwen/
└── ccnet/ # ccnet config
└── seafile-data/ # seafile config and data
└── seahub-data/  # seahub data
└── seahub.db     # seahub database file
└── seahub_settings.py # seahub custom settings
└── seafile-server
    └── runtime/
    └── seahub/
</pre>

=== Change the old layout to the new layout ===

* Go to the top level directory (in our example it is '''/data/haiwen''')

<pre>
cd /data/haiwen
</pre>

* Create the '''seafile-server''' directory, and move the <code>seahub/</code> and <code>runtime/</code> directory into it.

<pre>
mkdir seafile-server
mv seahub seafile-server/
mv runtime seafile-server/
</pre>

* Move the seahub database file outside, and create seahub_settings.py

<pre>
mv seafile-server/seahub/seahub.db seahub.db
touch seahub_settings.py
</pre>

* Move the seahub avatars directory outside, and create a symbolic link to it

<pre>
mkdir seahub-data
cd seafile-server/seahub/media
mv avatars ../../../seahub-data/
ln -s ../../../seahub-data/avatars
</pre>
